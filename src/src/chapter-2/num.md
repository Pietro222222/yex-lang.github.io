Nums in Yex are implemented as Float64, so we have a float value that uses 8 bytes of ram. its max value is `179769313486231570000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`. yea, thats a lot and you likely wont need this (if you do, the hell are you doing? lol)


theres not too much to talk about numbers because they're very simple.
